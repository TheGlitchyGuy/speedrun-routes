# Pokemon Blue No Item Underflow
**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

I highly recommend to watch [Rosstafari's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmIru_VnLgI&t=2s)

## Before doing a new run

- Clear the save data by pressing Up + Select + B on the title screen and then toggling Down to say Yes. 
- If playing on Emulator, either Hard Reset before each individual attempt or capture the entire emulator border in order for the run to be valid.
- On the New Game screen enter the Options menu, and set Text Speed to Fast and Battle Animations to Off

## Intro

Name yourself a **5-letters** name(5 As is the fastest) and your rival the **first default name** by clearing the preceding text box with B and buffering Down and A.

## Before Rival

- The fight against the rival is very risky, so if you are not wanting a WR time **you should take the PC potion**.
> This can be done quickly buffering a B press immediately after talking to the PC to clear the first instant text box, then mash A until the Potion is being withdrawn, and lastly mash B (and hold right) to exit the PC.
- Exit the house and walk into Route 1 to trigger the cut scene.
- Choose the third ball to obtain Bulbasaur and nickname it **"A"**. 
> Buffer dex entry with B, press A (confirm choice), mash A (nickname)

## Rival Fight

- You **must** win this fight to level up to Lvl 6. if you loose, then reset.
- Spam Tackle(Mash A)
  - If you are at 6hp or lower and you know you won't kill him next turn, potion.
  > This is because Charmander can Crit
