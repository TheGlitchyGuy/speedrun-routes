# Pokemon Blue No Item Underflow
**CLEAR SAVE DATA FOR EACH ATTEMPT OR YOUR RUN IS INVALID**

I highly recommend to watch [Rosstafari's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmIru_VnLgI&t=2s)

## Before doing a new run

- Clear the save data by pressing Up + Select + B on the title screen and then toggling Down to say Yes. 
- If playing on Emulator, either Hard Reset before each individual attempt or capture the entire emulator border in order for the run to be valid.
- On the New Game screen enter the Options menu, and set Text Speed to Fast and Battle Animations to Off

## Intro

Name yourself a **5-letters** name(5 As is the fastest) and your rival the **first default name** by clearing the preceding text box with B and buffering Down and A.

## Before Rival

- The fight against the rival is very risky, so if you are not wanting a WR time **you should take the PC potion**.
> This can be done quickly buffering a B press immediately after talking to the PC to clear the first instant text box, then mash A until the Potion is being withdrawn, and lastly mash B (and hold right) to exit the PC.
- Exit the house and walk into Route 1 to trigger the cut scene.
- Choose the third ball to obtain Bulbasaur and nickname it **"A"**. 
> Buffer dex entry with B, press A (confirm choice), mash A (nickname)

## Rival Fight

- You **must** win this fight to level up to Lvl 6. if you loose, then reset.
- Spam Tackle(Mash A)

  - If you are at **6hp or lower and you know you won't kill him next turn**, heal with potion.

    > This is because Charmander can Crit on Scratch and deal you 6 HP.
- **WHEN LEVELING UP, DON'T SKIP THE STATS SCREEN : CHECK FOR SPECIAL** :

  - If you have 12 special (Bad) : Reset. Or if you really want, try the backup [PP Strats](https://pokemon-speedrunning.github.io/speedrun-routes/#/gen-1/red-blue/catext/reverse-badge-acquisition/resources/Brock-Through-Walls-Guide?id=pp-strat).
  - If you have 13 special(Great) : We'll need to do an extra battle in Route 1, Lvl 2/3 Rats and Lvl 2 Pidgeys are prefered.
    - Run away if Lvl 3 pidgey.
  - If you have 14 special(Perfect) : No need to do an extra battle, play normally.
 
 ## Oak's Parcel
- Exit Oak's Lab, travel up Route 1, and enter the Viridian City Mart to obtain Oak's Parcel.
> If you don't get an encounter here that's ok, you stil have 2 opportunities left(back to Pallet Town, Back to Viridian)
- Exit the mart, enter Route 1, and head back to the lab.
- Talk to Oak from the left, it saves time because our rival has less steps to do.

## Brock Throughs Walls(BTW)

The first glitch we will perform is called Brock Through Walls.
The detail of the strat we're going to use is also written [here](https://pokemon-speedrunning.github.io/speedrun-routes/#/gen-1/red-blue/catext/reverse-badge-acquisition/resources/Brock-Through-Walls-Guide?id=without-bulbasaur-manipulation)
> When selecting the manip if you follow the strat from the page above, choose the **5 characters players name** or just follow the guide here.

- Head to Viridian Mart : buy
  - 2 Pokeballs
 > Note : You can buy extras balls if you are afraid to fail the **yoloball*, but later in the run you will **NEED** to know how to do a yoloball, so it's up to you.
